# Scripts and usages
General scripts that can be helpful for small stuff

## calculate.ratio.x.y.py
I wanted to upload an image to [my website](https://amiriry.github.io/).<br>
So I wanted it to be smaller but in the same ratio as before.<br>
I know how to do that with pinta, but I wanted to have a tool to do that.<br>
So obviously created a script.<br>
You give it a file name, with whatever type of image you want,<br>
It asks you on what base you want the ration, hieght or width.<br>
Enter the number you want, and it will find the width/height according to what you chose. <br>
It will also change the type to png.<br>

### zxclipboard
Use it in linux as a command after pipeline(|) and it will take whatever output comes from the command<br>
before the pipeline and put it in clipboard.<br>
Very useful.<br>
