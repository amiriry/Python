# Scripts and usages
General scripts that can be helpful for small stuff

## calculate.ratio.x.y.py
I wanted to upload an image to my website [a link](https://amiriry.github.io/).
So I wanted it to be smaller but in the same ratio as before.
I know how to do that with pinta, but I wanted to have a tool to do that.
So obviously created a script.
You give it a file name, with whatever type of image you want,
It asks you on what base you want the ration, hieght or width.
Enter the number you want, and it will find the width/height according to what you chose. 
It will also change the type to png.

### zxclipboard
Use it in linux as a command after pipeline(|) and it will take whatever output comes from the command
before the pipeline and put it in clipboard.
Very useful.
